## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the
> the primary functions available to users of the app. Be sure to
> describe exactly what APIs you are using and how they are connected
> in a meaningful way.

> **Also, include the GitHub `https` URL to your repository.**

    This app allows a user to input a value between 1-30, one ID for each NBA team, to receive data
    about any team including its full name, conference, division, and abbreviation. It then loads additional
    information gathered from an internet search about the team. The way I accomplisehed this was using the
    BallDontLie API to retrieve the initial information from the inputted team ID, and then using the team name
    and city as the query for the SerpStack API, which I used to retrieve information such as the date
    a team was founded. The SerpStack API is used to return google results of certain queries, which is
    exactly what I did.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

    Something new that I learned from working on this project is how important planning out an idea is.


## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

    If I could start the project over from scratch, I'd first draw out a plan of action. While working
    on this project, I went through 3 different ideas before finally getting to this one.  This project took
    genuinely forever, and unfortunately during my working progress I was dealing with loss in my family which
    made working on it even more challenging.
